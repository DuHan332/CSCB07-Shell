What did I work on in the last three days?
    - reviewed and modified CRC Cards with other team members.
    - Discuss with team members about the way to give the output in JShell.
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for InputInterpreter and Output 
      commands. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish InputInterpreter and Output commands
    - communicate with team members to improve cooperation of basic command
     (JShell, InputInterpreter, Output and Exit) 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - How to give the output to users. i.e. creating a output file and 
     continuously modify it when calling a function or get the returned output 
     from every specific function
