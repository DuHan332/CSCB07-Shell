What did I work on in the last three days?, 
    - Create CopyURL class and test it simply.
    - Modify the InputInterpreter class to make it compatible with the new 
      version of LoadJShell commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Write all the test case for the command I have implement.
	- Write Javadoc for new class I have written in Sprint2.
	- Format all the class.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to setup the test status for each command.
