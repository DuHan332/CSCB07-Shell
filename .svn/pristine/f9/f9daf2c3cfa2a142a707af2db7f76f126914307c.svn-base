What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on CRCcards
    - modified user stories and Sprint backlog to a better designation.
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for JShell and Exit

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish JShell and Exit


Am I blocked on anything?
    - The designing of JShell. i.e., what functions should JShell has and
    what variable should JShell has.
