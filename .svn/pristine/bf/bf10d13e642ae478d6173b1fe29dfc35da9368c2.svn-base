What did I work on in the last three days?, 
    - fixed the bugs in the MakeDirectory
    - write base codes for EchoOverwrite
    - write base codes for EchoOverAppend

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- continue to work on EchoOverwrite
	- continue to work on EchoOverAppend
	- discuss with other team members about how to design the ErrorChecker and 
	  work on it


Am I blocked on anything?
    - the design about ErrorChecker method
    - how to deal with the string of the input in the Echo, because as a string,
      it could contain any character
