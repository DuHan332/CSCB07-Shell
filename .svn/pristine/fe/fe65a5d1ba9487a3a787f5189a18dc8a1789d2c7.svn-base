What did I work on in the last three days?
    - created a new helper function named isValidName that is able to check 
      whether the name of directory or file contains invalid character
    - wrote and updated the JavaDoc
    - fixed the bugs in the class of RemoveDirectory
    - modified some codes in the class of MakeDirectory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- plan to work on classes of SaveJShell and LoadJShell
	- write the JUnit Test
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - don't know how to save the JShell into a file and load it
