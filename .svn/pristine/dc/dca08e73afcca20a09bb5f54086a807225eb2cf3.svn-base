What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Distribute work for Sprint2 and discuss CRC cards with the team
    - Test the part of the project that complete in Sprint1
    - Brainstormed redesign ideas with team for how to correctly interpret
      user's input with the new condition in Sprint2.
    - Explore how each command in assignment handout acts in PowerShell to get 
      an example of how our program should be like 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish the class that I was assigned in Sprint2
    - Improve the InputInterpreter so that it can take in String as parameter
    - Modify tracker to track the stack of directory

Am I blocked on anything?
    - How should I tell the different from String input and address input 
      correctly
