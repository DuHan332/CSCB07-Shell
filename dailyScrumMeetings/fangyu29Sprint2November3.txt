What did I work on in the last three days?
    - fixed bugs in MakeDirectory
    - wrote codes for classes of EchoAppend, EchoOverwrite
    - make functions can throw errors when errors appear


What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- fix bugs in classes of EchoAppend, EchoOverwrite
	- write Javadoc for previous functions that have been done
    - work on tasks that are in the Sprint3
    - discuss with team members about how to improve our program
    - prepare for showing demo on Thursday 

Am I blocked on anything?
	- don't know how to write good Javadoc for functions
	- fail to add a new file to its root's sublist
