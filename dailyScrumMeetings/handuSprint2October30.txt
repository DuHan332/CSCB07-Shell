    - revised and fixed the bugs in the List command
    - brainstormed and implemented the Echo command
    - brainstormed and implemented the History command
    - discussed and modified the process of whole program.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

	- review CRC cards to check if we need anything new
    - work on ErrorChecker methods with teammates

Am I blocked on anything?

    - how could our codes have a better structure
