What did I work on in the last three days?
    - wrote base codes for classes of SaveJShell and LoadJShell
    - wrote some JUnit Tests

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- continue working on writing JUnit Tests
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - loadJShell command is not able to load
    - what cases that tests need
