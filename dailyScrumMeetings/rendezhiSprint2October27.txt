What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implement the function that I have been assigned.
    - Learn HashMap and interface and use them in my code instead of too many if
      statements.
    - Brainstormed redesign ideas with team for the code structure of each 
      command so that they can fit for the HashMap and interface requirement
    - Discuss with team about the potential error reaction for each command if 
      receiving a improper input.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish Sprint2Backlog with team and distribute work more properly. (This 
      is because in Sprint1 we found that some parts of the work are more 
      relative than other)
    - Review CRC cards about class in Sprint2.
    - Test the whole project before we start writing code for Sprint2.
    - Writing the code that handling error for all the commands.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Will I need to Create a HashMap for all error case? Or try to use 
      "catch exception" method.
